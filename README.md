# GuildLounge
GuildLounge is a Client/Launcher for GW2 displaying API data, managing add-ons, accounts and more.

About the repository, "delta" is the main-branch instead of "master",
because at some point the merging of the branches into master created an absolute fiesta, so I continued developing on my branch.
(Just as a heads up. I will clean the branches eventually.)
